                        our computers for so many things. Games, email, homework, directions youtube there are so many
                        things we rely on our computer’s for. And so many threats to our computers. Eventually, they are
                        bound to get slowed down by a seemingly endless number of viruses, malware and potentially
                        unwanted programs. Parts sometimes will fail and need to be replaced or maybe upgrades are
                        necessary to keep your computer from becoming obsolete.</p>
                    <p class="w3-large">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give me a call or email me. I will try my best to help you with any issue your having with
                        technology even if it’s not a service I provide, I may be able to point you to a solution. I
                        started in computer repair in 2001. Since then I’ve gotten to see technology evolve and become a
                        part of everyone’s lives. Alot has changed since then but one thing hasn’t. Windows based
                        computers still malfunction all the time.</p>

                        Maybe you need a website or you need a solution for your office that will make you more
                        efficient, you might need help with email, network security, setting up a network, Setting up a
                        website, finding the right software, or getting your printer to work. The list is long enough
                        that it quickly gets to be overwhelming so I won’t list it all here. Just know that you can call
                        for some advice and you wont be pressured to open your wallet. Or pushed into getting fancy
                        unnecessary tech you don’t need. In most cases I can find you a way to save money not spend it
                        unwisely.</p>
